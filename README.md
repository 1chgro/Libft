# Libft
Libft is a personal implementation of essential C functions that you typically find in the C Standard Library. This project is designed to strengthen your understanding of low-level memory management, string manipulation, and linked list operations.

## Project Overview

This library provides a collection of fundamental functions to assist with common tasks like:

- Memory management (`ft_bzero`, `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, etc.)
- String manipulation (`ft_strjoin`, `ft_strlen`, `ft_strchr`, etc.)
- Character validation (`ft_isdigit`, `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isprint`, etc.)
- Linked list operations (`ft_lstadd_back`, `ft_lstsize`, `ft_lstclear`, etc.)

The goal was not only to implement these functions but to also delve deeper into memory management, pointer manipulation, and structure handling in C.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned and strengthened the following skills:

- **Memory Management:** How to allocate and manipulate memory in C using custom functions like `ft_malloc` and `ft_calloc`.
- **String Handling:** Writing efficient string functions to parse, compare, and manipulate strings, like `ft_strjoin`, `ft_strlcpy`, and `ft_strtrim`.
- **Linked Lists:** Implementing linked list operations from scratch to manage dynamic data structures.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Dealing with various edge cases like empty strings, NULL pointers, and invalid inputs to ensure the robustness of each function.
- **C Syntax and Structuring:** Improving overall C syntax, organization, and best practices for creating a reusable library.

This project reinforced the importance of careful memory management and the value of understanding basic data structures. It has provided me with a solid foundation for handling more complex C-based tasks in future projects.
